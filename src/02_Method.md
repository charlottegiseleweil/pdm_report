##Identifying display needs
1/ Based on typical example cases, and interviews of Natcappers we identify some needs
Then refine and complete this list of display needs thanks to the inputs of the broader FWAT team.
Finally, these needs were organized and gathers in a google doc sent out to a broader community of professionals in the field, including hydrologist, economists (...) working. They commented for each stated need about its usefulness. 

Survey : several forms (questions in annex)
surveying and interviewing (Hydrologist, economists etc)at the Natural cpital project


##Cases
###The Upper Tana Nairobi Water Fund*Improving Water for Millions in Kenya*The Tana River supplies 95 percent of the water for Nairobi’s 4 million residents, and for another 5 million people living in the watershed. It also feeds one of the country’s most important agricultural areas and provides half of the country’s hydropower output. With Nairobi contributing 60 percent of the country’s GDP, the Tana River truly fuels Kenya’s economic growth.Since the 1970s, forests on steep hillsides and areas of wetlands have been converted to agriculture, removing natural areas for storing runoff water and soil from the land. Now, as rain falls over farms, soils are washed down into the river, which reduces the productivity of farmland and sends sediment into the rivers. This increased sedimentation can choke water treatment and distribution facilities causing complete service disruptions for days or weeks at a time. Today, 60 percent of Nairobi’s residents do not have access to a reliable water supply.This growing challenge requires something innovative to protect the Tana River, increase downstream water quality and quantity and provide positive benefits for tens of thousands of farmers in the watershed. Enter the Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund. Water funds are founded on the principle that it is cheaper to prevent water problems at the source than it is to address them further downstream. Public and private donors and major water consumers downstream contribute to the Fund to support upstream water and soil conservation measures, resulting in improved water quality and supply.The Nairobi Water Fund builds on the Conservancy’s experience addressing similar issues in Latin America, where more than 30 water funds are either underway or in development. This fund is now the first of its kind in Africa, and will serve as a model as leaders across the continent look for innovative ways to solve ever-increasing water challenges.• Training for 15,000 farmers• Establishing the business case a $10 million USD investment in water fund-ledconservation interventions is likely to return $21.5 million USD in economic benefitsover a 30-year timeframe.• Our current partners and investors are: Nairobi City Water & Sewerage Company, KenyaElectricity Generating Company (KenGen), Pentair Inc, Coca Cola, East Africa Breweries Ltd, International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), The Government of Kenya, Water Resources Management Authority (WRMA), Tana & Athi Rivers

#### Defining the needs
In terms of static visualizations. The main goal of the paper  is to look at the impact of restoration (land cover scenarios) on the ES objectives (water, flammability) both independently and then simultaneously with climate scenarios going on in the background.
