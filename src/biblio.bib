abstract = {Graph Morphing, the first concept developed under the newly proposed paradigm of Visual Design Steering (VDS), is applied to optimal design problems. Graph Morphing, described in Part I of this paper, can be used to provide insights to a designer to improve efficiency, reliability, and accuracy of an optimal design in less cycle time. It is demonstrated in this part of the paper that Graph Morphing can be used to provide insights into design variable impact, constraint redundancy, reasonable values for constraint allowable limits, and function smoothness, that otherwise might not be attainable.},

@article{Fleming05,
abstract = {Evolutionary multicriteria optimization has traditionally concentrated on problems comprising 2 or 3 objectives. While engineering design problems can often be conveniently formulated as multiobjective optimization problems, these often comprise a relatively large number of objectives. Such problems pose new challenges for algorithm design, visualisation and implementation. Each of these three topics is addressed. Progressive articulation of design pref- erences is demonstrated to assist in reducing the region of interest for the search and, thereby, simplified the problem. Parallel coordinates have proved a useful tool for visualising many objectives in a two-dimensional graph and the compu- tational grid and wireless Personal Digital Assistants offer technological solu- tions to implementation difficulties arising in complex system design.},

@article{Reed04,
abstract = {This study demonstrates the use of high-order Pareto optimization ?i.e., optimizing a system for more than two objectives? on a long-term monitoring ?LTM? application. The LTM application combines quantile kriging and the nondominated sorted genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to successfully balance four objectives: ?1? minimizing sampling costs, ?2? maximizing the accuracy of interpo- lated plume maps, ?3? maximizing the relative accuracy of contaminant mass estimates, and ?4? minimizing estimation uncertainty. Optimizing the LTM application with respect to these objectives reduced the decision space of the problem from a total of 500 million designs to a set of 1,156 designs identified on the Pareto surface. Visualization of a total of eight designs aided in understanding and balancing the objectives of the application en route to a single compromise solution. This study shows that high-order Pareto optimization holds significant potential as a tool that can be used in the balanced design of water resources systems},
