@article{Hadka2015,
abstract = {This study introduces a new open source software framework to support bottom-up environmental systems planning under deep uncertainty with a focus on many-objective robust decision making (MORDM), called OpenMORDM. OpenMORDM contains two complementary components: (1) a software application programming interface (API) for connecting planning models to computational exploration tools for many-objective optimization and sensitivity-based discovery of critical deeply uncertain factors; and (2) a web-based visualization toolkit for exploring high-dimensional datasets to better understand system trade-offs, vulnerabilities, and dependencies. We demonstrate the OpenMORDM framework on a challenging environmental management test case termed the "lake problem". The lake problem has been used extensively in the prior environmental decision science literature and, in this study, captures the challenges posed by conflicting economic and environmental objectives, a water quality "tipping point" beyond which the lake may become irreversibly polluted, and multiple deeply uncertain factors that may undermine the robustness of pollution management policies. The OpenMORDM software framework enables decision makers to identify policy-relevant scenarios, quantify the trade-offs between alternative strategies in different scenarios, flexibly explore alternative definitions of robustness, and identify key system factors that should be monitored as triggers for future actions or additional planning. The web-based OpenMORDM visualization toolkit allows decision makers to easily share and visualize their datasets, with the option for analysts to extend the framework with customized scripts in the R programming language. OpenMORDM provides a platform for constructive decision support, allowing analysts and decision makers to interactively discover promising alternatives and potential vulnerabilities while balancing conflicting objectives.},

@article{ABMleelig,
abstract = {The proliferation of agent-based models (ABMs) in recent decades has motivated model practitioners to improve the transparency, replicability, and trust in results derived from ABMs. The complexity of ABMs has risen in stride with advances in computing power and resources, resulting in larger models with complex interactions and learning and whose outputs are often high-dimensional and require sophisticated analytical approaches. Similarly, the increasing use of data and dynamics in ABMs has further enhanced the complexity of their outputs. In this article, we offer an overview of the state-of-the-art approaches in analyzing and reporting ABM outputs highlighting challenges and outstanding issues. In particular, we examine issues surrounding variance stability (in connection with determination of appropriate number of runs and hypothesis testing), sensitivity analysis, spatio-temporal analysis, visualization, and effective communication of all these to non-technical audiences, such as various stakeholders.},

abstract = {Evolutionary multicriteria optimization has traditionally concentrated on problems comprising 2 or 3 objectives. While engineering design problems can often be conveniently formulated as multiobjective optimization problems, these often comprise a relatively large number of objectives. Such problems pose new challenges for algorithm design, visualisation and implementation. Each of these three topics is addressed. Progressive articulation of design pref- erences is demonstrated to assist in reducing the region of interest for the search and, thereby, simplified the problem. Parallel coordinates have proved a useful tool for visualising many objectives in a two-dimensional graph and the compu- tational grid and wireless Personal Digital Assistants offer technological solu- tions to implementation difficulties arising in complex system design.},

@article{Reed04,
abstract = {This study demonstrates the use of high-order Pareto optimization ?i.e., optimizing a system for more than two objectives? on a long-term monitoring ?LTM? application. The LTM application combines quantile kriging and the nondominated sorted genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to successfully balance four objectives: ?1? minimizing sampling costs, ?2? maximizing the accuracy of interpo- lated plume maps, ?3? maximizing the relative accuracy of contaminant mass estimates, and ?4? minimizing estimation uncertainty. Optimizing the LTM application with respect to these objectives reduced the decision space of the problem from a total of 500 million designs to a set of 1,156 designs identified on the Pareto surface. Visualization of a total of eight designs aided in understanding and balancing the objectives of the application en route to a single compromise solution. This study shows that high-order Pareto optimization holds significant potential as a tool that can be used in the balanced design of water resources systems},

abstract = {The comparison of spatial patterns is recognized as an important task in landscape ecology especially when spatially explicit simulation modeling or remote sensing is applied. Yet, there is no agreed procedure for doing that, probably because different problems require different algorithms. We explored a variety of existing algorithms and modified some of them to compare grid-based maps with categorical attrib- utes. A new algorithm based on the “expanding window” approach was developed and compared to other known algorithms. The goal was to offer simple and flexible proce- dures for comparing spatial patterns in grid based maps that do not take into consideration object shapes and sizes of the maps. The difference between maps was characterized by three values: quantity, location, and distance between corresponding categories in the maps. Combinations of these indices work as good criteria to quantify differences between maps. A web-based survey was set up, in which participants were asked to grade the similarity of ten pairs of maps. These results were then used to compare how well the various algorithms can perform relative to the visual comparisons obtained; they were also used to calibrate existing algorithms.},

Location error occurs when the location of a category in one map is different from the location of that category in the other map. The standard Kappa index of agreement is usually not appropriate for map comparison. This paper offers altenative statistics: (1) proportion correct with perfect ability to specify location, (2) proportion correct with perfect ability to specify quantity, (3) Kappa for no ability, (4) Kappa for location, and (5) Kappa for quantity. These statistics can help scientists improve classification. This paper applies these theoretical concepts to the validation of a land-use change model for the lpswich Watershed in Massachusetts.},

Second, multiple instances of a simulation can be run to sample the results of parameters within a given space instead of at a single point.
