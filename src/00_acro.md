# Acronyms & Terminology {.unnumbered}

**Important concepts & terminology**[^123back]

[^123back]: The field of ecosystem services suffers some inconsistent terminology in literature [@Englund]. Hence, an effort is made here to define precisely the terms used, point out synonyms and vague terminology, to avoid confusions.

* Natural capital: Natural capital includes all environmental assets, it is the stock of resources, such a rivers, trees, the atmosphere and all living organisms [@naturalcapitalscotland]
* ES: Ecosystem services are the benefits natural capital assets provide to humanity [@cardinale2012]
* SDU: spatial decision unit, corresponding to a geometric feature such as polygon, pixel, lines or point. SDU represent the scale at which a discrete spatial decision/intervention is undertaken. In the context of map comparisons, the word "cell" is used in this work for SDU, to match with the literature on the topic. 
* LULC: land use/land cover
* intervention/activity: an action that can be taken on a spatial decision unit that gets reflected in parameters that feed an ecosystem services model
* portfolio: A set of SDU's and chosen activities for each SDU, emerging from an optimizer, from RIOS, or a participatory prioritization process. Portfolios get overlayed on LULC's to run the model
* scenarios: storylines that describe possible futures (but are not predictions) [@greggg] (e.g an LULC scenario corresponds to an LULC map that has been changed based on modeled or user-defined changes to represent plausible futures)
* spatial targeting: prioritization of interventions and their location on a landscape, can be undertaken with formal optimization methods, or heuristic or participatory approaches
* SOW: state of the world (scenario with quantitative definition)\

**Jargon of the field**

* ABM: Agent-Based Modeling (computational modeling of phenomena as dynamical systems of interacting agents)
* API: Application Programming Interface
* EIA: Environmental Impact Assessment
* GIS: Geographical Information Systems
* IWS: Investments in watershed services (known as Water Fund)
* MOEA: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm* MOVA: Multi-objective visual analytics
* OGR: OpenGIS Simple Features Reference Implementation* OR: Operational research* PCA: Principal component analysis
* PFF: Production possibilities frontier (economical term for tradeoff curve)* RO: Robust optimization
* SA: Sensitivity analysis
* SLR: Sea Level Rise* SDSS: Spatial decision support systems 
* UA: uncertainty analysis\
