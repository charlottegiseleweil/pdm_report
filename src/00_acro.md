# Acronyms & Terminology {.unnumbered}

**Important concepts & terminology**[^1back] (TODO)

[^1back]: The field of ecosystem services suffers some inconsistent terminology in literature [@Englund]. Hence, an effort is made here to define precisely the terms used, point out synonyms and vague terminology, to avoid confusions.

* Natural capital : * Natural capital is the world's stock of natural resources, which includes geology, soils, air, water and all living organisms. Natural capital assets provide people with a wide range of free goods and services, often called ecosystem services, which underpin our economy and society and some of which even make human life possible [@naturalcapitalscotland]
 natural capital, such as trees, minerals, ecosystems, the atmosphere, etc.; manufactured capital, such as machines and buildings; and the human capital of physical bodies [@costanza1997value]

* ES : Ecosystem services are the benefits nature provides to humanity [@cardinale2012]

* SDU : spatial decision unit, unit where a change on the land/seascape is made -- pixel (eg, in RIOS), or polygon (eg, for marine protected area). In the context of map comparisons, the word "cell" is used in this work for SDU, to match with the literature on the topic. 
From optimizer design doc "  In the scope of this framework, the set of possible decisions are represented by ESRI Shapefiles containing polygons, lines and/or points indicating where spatial decisions can be made.  These geometric features are called Spatial Decision Units (SDUs) and represent a discrete spatial decision/intervention which can be used to meet optimization objectives such that they are restricted by constraints.  "
= cell
* scenarios = storylines that describe possible futures (but aren't predicitons) [@greggg]
* SOW : state of the world (scenario with quantitative definition)
intervention/activity: an action that can be taken on a spatial decision unit that gets reflected in parameters that feed an ecosystem services model. In the FWAT context, this typically means changing the LULC to a new row of the biophysical table that has modified values
* LULC : land use/land cover
* LULC scenario = A LULC map that has been changed based on modeled or user-defined changes to represent plausible futures INDEPENDENT of implementing an optimization or other portfolio (this may be different than how others see it)
portfolio = (etc cf gnrl trckr) - A set of SDU's and chosen activities for each SDU, emerging from an optimizer, from RIOS, or a participatory priortization process. Portfolios get overlayed on LULC's to run the model

**Jargon of the field acronyms**
