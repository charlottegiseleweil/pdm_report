![When Evaluating a Figure for Clarity and Completeness, Consider the Following Questions[@Allen1]](../images/assess_table.png){#fig:crit2 width=80%} 

![Land cover in Pu‘u Wa‘awa‘a under different restoration and climate scenarios. The purple contours on the current land cover map outline the enclosure areas corresponding to the partial restoration scenario. The maps on top correspond to the evolution of land cover, under the current climate for the partial and full restoration scenarios. The maps underneath correspond to the evolution of the land cover, under the RCP 8.5 future climate projection for the partial and full restoration scenarios. (figure by author in @PWW)](../images/Fig1.pdf){#fig:hawaii1 width=80%}

![Impact of restoration on groundwater recharge in Pu‘u Wa‘awa‘a. The green contours outline the enclosure areas corresponding to the partial restoration scenario in which only these regions undergo some changes. Blue corresponds to an increase in groundwater recharge due to restoration, and red corresponds to a decrease. (figure by author in @PWW)](../images/Fig2.pdf){#fig:hawaii2 width=80%}

![Impact of restoration on landscape flammability in Pu‘u Wa‘awa‘a. The green contours outline the enclosure areas corresponding to the partial restoration scenario. Yellow corresponds to a decrease in landscape flammability due to restoration, and red means no change. (figure by author in @PWW)](../images/Fig3.pdf){#fig:hawaii3 width=80%}

![Spatial prioritization and restoration costs in in Pu‘u Wa‘awa‘a. For each objective and both combined. Rank 1 pixels correspond to the highest priority restoration areas. Costs are cumulative, such that if Rank n is restored, Rank n-1 was restored as well. The green contours outline the enclosure areas corresponding to the partial restoration scenario.
