# Conclusion & Next Steps

##Natural capital sustainable management : a huge potential for impact
*"To meet the global need for conservation funding, investable cash flows from conservation projects need to be at least 20-30 times greater than they are today, reaching USD 200-300 billion per year"*
@McKinsey (CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, WWF and McKinsey)

#### A huge unexplored potential, and an unmet demand for investment{.unnumbered}
There is an enormous potential for environmental impact and climate change mitigation through an informed management of natural capital. Aligned the 17 UN sustainability goals, and the *??* of Paris agreement. (ref)

So called conservation finance (i.e a financial investment **?** as defined by @McKinsey) has a large unrealized potential, as noted by the @McKinsey report. The demand for funding is yet significantly unmet, and the private sector opportunities are widely unexploited. 

Possible causes explaining this unmet demand include:

* **Measurable conservation benefits:** This report notes one major problem: the fact that the ROI of these project are hardly measurable, @McKinsey deplores that the benefits are yet to be precisely identified and standardized. However, this is exactly the problem natural capital assessments, among which the ones conducted by The Natural Capital Project, are solving. Partnering cutting-edge
* **Conservation finance still small**:The conservation investment opportunities, especially for the private sector aren't available at scale. However, banks and asset managers could develop the conversation finance possibilities as part of their impact investment offer. This may actually be an amazing opportunity, supported by tools such as [the Natural Capital Protocol](http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/protocol/).
* **A sector historically reserved to NGOs and philantrophy**: Traditionally, conservation projects have not focused on economical return on investment in the business model type of way, therefore appealing mostly philanthropy, rather than the banking or private sector.

#### Moving forward: linking the right expertise {.unnumbered}
From this constat, it seems to the author that linking the right expertise would allow to bridge the gaps and open the doors to many much needed investments and high impact projects. In this context data visualization tools are crucial to connect the complex scientific results to the real world.

Several initiatives are going in this direction, Credit Suisse for example, stated their long-term intent of creating a conservation finance asset class.  *(ref check!)*.
It has been proven to be possible to deliver great conservation impacts while generating returns for investors ((*good reference bpb?*) and @McKinsey). 
Furthermore, @McKinsey states that *"There would be sufficient financial capital available to meet conservation investment needs if the main investor segments globally allocated 1% of their new and reinvested capital to conservation."*


##On standardizing approaches to communicate natural capital results (concluding remarks about the display toolbox)
As the community is longing for a standardized method to quantify and map ES (@Englund, @Crossman, @Maria) (in terms of scale, types of ES...), number of strategies are being developed on the visualization front. Interactive tools are being more and more used and created, as tools to develop them are becoming more and more accessible.

Similarly to @Englund, it is found to be difficult to generalize one best method. Rather, best practices were suggested. Approaches are very context dependent. According to the aim, intended audience, analyst competence, data availabiloty, time frame ...

The proposed display toolbox (chapters \ref{sec:elements} and \ref{sec:UserGuide})


###Open questions and identified areas of improvement {.unnumbered}
Remain some open questions and areas of improvements were identified. The question of the scale, **the effect of the resolution** chosen on the results can be further explored *ref?*. Additionnally, the survey noted growing interest in the topic of **beneficiaries**. Not only quantifying the people benefiting from an intervention, but more precisely adding nuance in demographics or social metrics to the analysis, classify by subgroups (e.g which fraction of service benefits accrue to vulnerable populations?) and/or contrast beneficiary distribution in space with service distribution in space. Also, displaying the **impact of intervention on a specific ES metric** could be further investigated. The usual approach looks at the overall change in ES, failing to detail how each intervention impacts each ES metric (i.e where in space does a given intervention or scenario improve or worsen a specific ES metric? e.g Where does an activity contribute to objectives ?)

## Ending note: engaging a broader audience into major decisions
An effective visualization of natural capital assessment results must simplifies its complexity to be understandable, while staying rigorous. It would communicates its point in an engaging way, allowing more actors to get involved in natural capital sustainable management. Many decisions and investments are today left apart, because the actors and investors do not understand the complex problematic, these visualization decision support tools really aims to solve this problem. aim of these. By involving a broader audience into major decisions, they are a democracy tool ! (*okay maybe getting too much there !*)
