# Conclusion & Next Steps

## Summary 

This work supports ES analysts striving to communicate effectively natural capital assessment results. Having identified the main challenges they face, it proposes approaches to ES visualizations and summaries in a toolbox tailored to the specific needs of ES analysts, supported by fundamental and applied data visualization guidelines. Throughout the exploration of tools and solutions, gaps were found; the idea of an innovative tool emerged to address some of them. An engaging interactive web application tailored to the most common needs of ES analysts was conceived, and a prototype developed and implemented for a specific use case, namely the Tana Water Fund. It generated enthusiasm among the ES community it was proposed to, and led to envisioning its further development, extending it to broader applications.

## Concluding remarks about the display toolbox: on standardizing approaches to communicate natural capital results 

As many in the ES community are calling for a standardized method to quantify and map ES (@Englund, @Crossman, @Maria), a number of strategies are being developed on the visualization front. Interactive tools are becoming increasingly common, as platforms to develop them are becoming more and more accessible.

Similarly to @Englund, this study finds it difficult to point one best method generically adequate to all cases. Rather, best practices were suggested in a display "toolbox" (chapters \ref{sec:elements} and \ref{sec:UserGuide}). Approaches are very context dependent. The tools and types of display must be chosen according to the aim, intended audience, analyst skills, data availability, time frame and other factors.

###Open questions and identified areas of improvement {.unnumbered}

Remain some open questions and areas of improvements were identified. The question of the scale, **the effect of the resolution** chosen on the results can be further explored. Additionally, the survey noted growing interest in the topic of **beneficiaries**. Not only quantifying the people benefiting from an intervention, but more precisely adding nuance in demographics or social metrics to the analysis, classify by subgroups (e.g. which fraction of service benefits accrue to vulnerable populations?) and/or contrast beneficiary distribution in space with service distribution in space.

##Concluding remarks about the developed tool: a successful concept with opportunities for further development
As noted in section \ref{sec:fidback}, feedback about the tool prototype underlined its engaging aspect. An overview of next steps is detailed in part \ref{sec:nextstepswebapp}. An important choice that would need to be considered in moving this project further is about the intended audience. Currently, the tool is both applicable for communication purposes to a broader audiences, and to support exploratory data analysis. Two different versions (one simplified for communication, and a more detailed and rigorous for analysis) could be envisioned. Future directions could decide to focus on one or the other intended applications. The analysis tool would need to be made generic, while the communication tool would require more design and user experience considerations. 

Considerations about server architecture (hosting the data on a separate server), and raster on the fly computations will also have to be further explored.

The success of the developed tool suggests for the Natural Capital project to showcase successful existing visualizations (e.g. the work of Gregg Verutes mentioned in section \ref{sec:resou}), for example on the website within the *stories* tab; as these help understanding the scope of natural capital assessments and projects. 

## Engaging a broader audience into major decisions on natural capital sustainable management

As noted in \ref{sec:conservation_finance}, there is a significant unmet demand for investment in the field of conservation, and aligned intentions to promote natural capital sustainable management both from the political world - as illustrated by the Paris agreement and the 17 UN sustainable development goals among others - and also emerging in the finance world (see [the Conservation Finance Network](http://www.conservationfinancenetwork.org/) for example). Natural capital conservation projects have the potential to have a tremendous impact, at large scale. 

However, their success seems contingent upon the ability of several fields to work together; linking different expertise seem indeed required bridge the gaps (for example through partnering investors looking for long term reliable and meaningful project with cutting-edge scientists modeling the behavior of ecosystems to quantify the costs and benefits from natural capital and its sustainable management). Multi-disciplinary communication therefore appears as a crucial aspect. In this context, data visualization tools play a key role to connect the complex scientific results to the real world.

Effective visualizations of natural capital assessment results must simplify their complexity to be understandable, while staying rigorous. Plus they communicate key points in an engaging way, allowing more actors to get involved in natural capital sustainable management. By involving a broader audience into major decisions, they support a participative and democratic approach to solving problems impacting large communities.

Advances in the topic of communication of natural capital assessments would arguably facilitate engagement of a broader audience. This work is a small step that could integrate to be part of a broader effort to facilitate communication between different fields.
