##Concluding remarks about the display toolbox: on standardizing approaches to communicate natural capital results 
As the community is longing for a standardized method to quantify and map ES (@Englund, @Crossman, @Maria) (in terms of scale, types of ES...), number of strategies are being developed on the visualization front. Interactive tools are being more and more used and created, as tools to develop them are becoming more and more accessible.

Similarly to @Englund, it is found to be difficult to generalize one best method. Rather, best practices were suggested in a display "toolbox" (chapters \ref{sec:elements} and \ref{sec:UserGuide}). Approaches are very context dependent. The tools and types of display must be chosen according to the aim, intended audience, analyst skills, data availability, time frame and other factors.

###Open questions and identified areas of improvement {.unnumbered}
Remain some open questions and areas of improvements were identified. The question of the scale, **the effect of the resolution** chosen on the results can be further explored *ref?*. Additionnally, the survey noted growing interest in the topic of **beneficiaries**. Not only quantifying the people benefiting from an intervention, but more precisely adding nuance in demographics or social metrics to the analysis, classify by subgroups (e.g which fraction of service benefits accrue to vulnerable populations?) and/or contrast beneficiary distribution in space with service distribution in space. Also, displaying the **impact of intervention on a specific ES metric** could be further investigated. The usual approach looks at the overall change in ES, failing to detail how each intervention impacts each ES metric (i.e where in space does a given intervention or scenario improve or worsen a specific ES metric? e.g Where does an activity contribute to objectives ?)

##Concluding remarks about developped web application prototype and next steps
**(Todo)** As noted in section \ref{sec:fidback}, feedback about the tool prototype underlined its engaging aspect. An overview of next steps is detailed in part \ref{sec:nextstepswebapp}. An important choice that would need to be considered in moving this project further is about the intended audience. Currently, the tool is both applicable for communication purposes to a broader audiences, and to support data analysis. Two different versions (one simplified for communication 


Future direction can focus on making the tool generic, 

Focus on the communication aspect of the tool

## Suggestions for the Natural Capital Project

##Natural capital sustainable management: great potential for impact

#### A great unexplored potential and unmet demand for investment{.unnumbered}
There is an enormous potential for environmental impact and climate change mitigation through an informed management of natural capital. Natural capital conservation is fully aligned with the [17 UN sustainable development goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/), and the Paris agreement (@Cop21, @Guardian among others). So called conservation finance (i.e a financial investment that aims to conserve the values of the ecosystem for the long term, as defined by @McKinsey) has a large unrealized potential, as noted by the same report. The demand for funding is yet significantly unmet[^9222back], and the private sector opportunities are widely unexploited. Possible causes explaining this unmet demand include:

* **Measurable conservation benefits:** @McKinsey notes one major problem: the fact that the ROI of this type of projects are hardly measurable, the same report deplores that the benefits are yet to be precisely identified and standardized. However, this is exactly the problem natural capital assessments, among which the ones conducted by The Natural Capital Project, are solving. 
* **Conservation finance still small**: The conservation investment opportunities, especially for the private sector aren't available at scale. However, banks and asset managers could develop the conversation finance possibilities as part of their impact investment offer. This may actually be a very profitable opportunity, supported by tools such as [the Natural Capital Protocol](http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/protocol/).
* **A sector historically reserved to NGOs and philantrophy**: Traditionally, conservation projects have not focused on economical return on investment in the business model type of way, therefore appealing mostly philanthropy, rather than the banking or private sector.

[^9222back]: @McKinsey calculates that, to meet the global need for conservation funding, investable cash flows from conservation projects need to be at least 20-30 times greater than they are today, reaching USD 200-300 billion per year.

#### Moving forward: linking the right expertise {.unnumbered}
From this constat, it seems to the author that linking the right expertise would allow to bridge the gaps and open the doors to many desired investments and high impact projects: partnering investors looking for long term reliable and meaningful project with cutting-edge scientists modeling the behavior of ecosystems to quantify the costs and benefits from natural capital and its sustainable management. In this context data visualization tools are crucial to connect the complex scientific results to the real world.

Several initiatives are going in this direction, Credit Suisse for example, expressed their long-term intent of creating a conservation finance asset class (@CS and @McKinsey). It has been proven to be possible to deliver great conservation impacts while generating returns for investors ((*good reference about that by any chance bpb?*) and @McKinsey). Furthermore, @McKinsey states that *"There would be sufficient financial capital available to meet conservation investment needs if the main investor segments globally allocated 1% of their new and reinvested capital to conservation."*

## Ending note: engaging a broader audience into major decisions
An effective visualization of natural capital assessment results must simplifies its complexity to be understandable, while staying rigorous. It would communicates its point in an engaging way, allowing more actors to get involved in natural capital sustainable management. Many decisions and investments are today left apart, because the actors and investors do not understand the complex problematic, these visualization decision support tools really aims to solve this problem. By involving a broader audience into major decisions, they are a democracy tool ! (*okay maybe getting too much there !*)
