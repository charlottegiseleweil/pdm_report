##Background & motivation 
### Ecosystem services
Ecosystem services (ES) are essential gifts from nature making life possible and worthwhile. These include food, water, fuel, fiber, timber, pollination, purification, medicinal plants, inspirational and recreational landscapes among plenty of other examples which may or may not be tangible or obvious. Environmental assets providing ecosystem services are referred to as natural capital. Forests, for example, not only provide a natural carbon storage that helps regulate climate, but also hold soil in place along streams, therefore improving water quality, which benefits people downstream. Habitats in rivers and along coastlines support populations of fish that provide food, including in areas of chronic food insecurity. Biodiversity stabilize ecosystems [@cardinale2012]. Mangroves stabilize shorelines and decrease damage to people and property from storms. Oceans also store carbon.

These services rely on complex interactions of many forms of natural capital; the ecosystems that surround us are essential to our survival and well-being, and are the bedrock of a sustainable economy. Nature and people form the biosphere; caring for one implies to care for the other. Increasingly, we can map the most important forests, coastal habitats and other ecosystems and show how they support us. This is crucial in order to prioritize the use of resources and sustainably manage our natural world. In short, nature is at the source of human well-being: people depend on nature. 

However, about 60% of the ecosystem services are being degraded[^2back] or are not used sustainably. Not only depletion of natural capital is a major loss to the environment, but it harms significantly human well-being [@Millennium2005]. Furthermore, the relationships between harm to an ecosystem and loss in its services are rarely linear and impacts generally multiply and  affect all linked ecosystem process [@cardinale2012].

As the stock of natural capital decreases, due to clear and increasing human alteration [@Vitousek494], citizens and scholars are increasingly highlighting the urgency of taking action to protect it. To do so, efficient policy design requires a strong (often quantitative) understanding of ecosystem services functioning.

### Natural capital sustainable management: a great potential for impact {#sec:conservation_finance}

There is an enormous potential for environmental impact and climate change mitigation through an informed management of natural capital. Natural capital conservation is fully aligned with the [17 UN sustainable development goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/), and the Paris agreement (@Cop21, @Guardian among others). So called conservation finance (i.e. a financial investment that aims to conserve the values of the ecosystem for the long term, as defined by @McKinsey) has a large unrealized potential, as noted by the same report. The demand for funding is yet significantly unmet[^9222back], and the private sector opportunities are widely unexploited. Possible causes explaining this unmet demand include:

* **Measurability of conservation benefits:** @McKinsey notes one major problem: the fact that the ROI of this type of projects are hardly measurable, the same report deplores that the benefits are yet to be precisely identified and standardized. However, this is exactly the problem natural capital assessments tackles, as explained in the following section.
* **Conservation finance is still small**: The conservation investment opportunities, especially for the private sector aren't available at scale. However, banks and asset managers could develop the conversation finance possibilities as part of their impact investment offer. This may actually be a very profitable opportunity, supported by tools such as [the Natural Capital Protocol](http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/protocol/).
* **A sector historically reserved to NGOs and philantropy**: Traditionally, conservation projects have not focused on economical return on investment in the business model type of way, therefore appealing mostly philanthropy, rather than the banking or private sector.

Building on this observation, this study is motivated by the hypothesis that linking the right expertise would allow to bridge the gaps and open the doors to many desired investments and high impact projects: partnering investors looking for long term reliable and meaningful project with cutting-edge scientists modeling the behavior of ecosystems to quantify the costs and benefits from natural capital and its sustainable management. Several initiatives are going in this direction, Credit Suisse for example, expressed their long-term intent of creating a conservation finance asset class [@CS]. It has been proven to be possible to deliver great conservation impacts while generating returns for investors [@McKinsey]. Furthermore, @McKinsey also states that *"There would be sufficient financial capital available to meet conservation investment needs if the main investor segments globally allocated 1% of their new and reinvested capital to conservation."*


[^9222back]: @McKinsey calculates that, to meet the global need for conservation funding, investable cash flows from conservation projects need to be at least 20-30 times greater than they are today, reaching USD 200-300 billion per year.

###Natural capital assessments

The benefits nature provides to people and the economy are difficult to quantify and often not valued in traditional accounting. Natural capital assessments aim to provide information on the matter; they help to understand the ecosystem services structures, involving quantitative estimates. Valuing ecosystem services aims to cultivate appreciation for the invisible benefits from nature [@AnneBlog], which too often happens only upon their loss [@daily2000].

![Examples of how a natural capital-based approach can be used to mainstream enviromental information throughout the development planning process, contributing to more effective and efficient development planning decisions, from [@Myanmar16]](../images/mymy.png){#fig:mymy}

Because degradation or loss of ecosystem benefits incurs costs, for example for water treatment, erosion control, infrastructure maintenance and disaster relief; they undermine security, prosperity and economic development. Therefore, a thorough understanding of natural capital assets is crucial. 

Such an understanding can be achieved through **natural capital assessments**, which locate the sources of ecosystem services, provide indications for sustainable management, identify and prioritize conservation activities, help build understanding of synergies and trade-offs between the needs and impacts of different projects or sectors, support policy design, and contribute to climate resilience and adaptation planning. These assessments document ecosystem services at different levels, from local ones such as pest control, to regional ones like flood control, to global services such as climate stabilization [@daily2000]. They reveal interdependencies between services, critical points and timescales for degradation and recovery. They are context-dependent and complex [@daily2000]. 

Generally, they follow the structure of first identifying the different alternatives or pathways, then quantifying their respective impacts, and finally valuing their respective consequences. A common measuring unit for this last step of valuation is monetary, but outcomes are not always aggregated into monetary terms [@daily2000]. However, an important clarification that must be highlighted when presenting the concept of natural capital, is that it does not aim to be merely putting a dollar tag on nature. On the contrary, the natural capital assessments approaches can be thought of as way to correct capitalist society’s bias that make decisions based on economical return on investment and often excludes nature in its calculations. Monetary valuation is just one small aspect of natural capital assessment, that helps connect in some contexts of financial planning and comparisons [@AnneBlog].

Based on this understanding, enlightened decisions can be taken to secure these assets in a context of social and economic development [@Myanmar16]. In short, natural capital assessments aim to make it easier for nature to become a primary consideration in all decisions, by revealing the specific benefits it provides [@AnneBlog]. 


### Communicating natural capital information
Given their complexity, natural capital assessments involve a substantial understanding of phenomena and their interaction, often requiring significant studies and modeling efforts. However, these efforts will do little to achieve their intended goal of informing decisions unless the insights they generate are effectively communicated to provide usable information to decision-makers. Therefore, the present work aims to put an emphasis on this last step of process, that is, conveying the results – in particular, strategies for visualization, which are often neglected in time-limited projects which had focused on the previous steps.

Visualization is the main focus of this work, because it has been proven to be easier for the brain to understand an image than words or numbers [@Cukier]. Because of their abilities to synthesize large amounts of data into effective displays [@Ware2000], graphics have been widely used in the literature. Plus, it had been shown that judgement often results from fast and automatic processing, generally prompted by visuals [@McMahon2016] and that combining optimization with visualization promotes design innovations and empowers decision makers with a better understanding of systems behaviors (see for example the work of @Kollat_Video, @Reed04, @Fleming05, @Winer02.  More specifically for spatial data, mapping, defined by @Englund as the organization of spatially explicit quantitative information, has proven essential for many assessments of ES [@Troy]. @Hauck showed how maps are tremendously helpful to support proper management of ecosystems and ecosystem services. However, he also brings attention to the fact that they should be used carefully. 

Not only visuals, but effective visuals are crucial to achieve the intended goal of informing their audience. This work draws from the widely studied topic of information visualization (by Cleveland, Ware, Tufte among others). Visualizations of large datasets and complex information is a very effective way to conveying knowledge, but it is also non-trivial, which might explain why this topic is given so much attention in the literature. 

Visualizations support both data analysis and data presentation. The latter is the focus of this work, which assumes that at least some initial results are generated. However, visualizations are not distinctly intended to serve just one purpose, and the same displays may also be of use for exploratory analysis by the analyst, to help build insight, especially to the extent that both an analyst's own work and their stakeholder engagement are iterative. 

Developing visuals that communicate the complexities of natural capital assessments is admittedly difficult, even with existing visual tools and expertise. A preliminary part of this work consisted in identifying the specific challenges related to displaying ES results. ES information consists in varied, large, multi-dimensional datasets, often including large numbers of results that come from considering multiple objectives, scenarios, and uncertainties. These can be categorical or continuous, spatial or aspatial. The main tasks that these displays aim to support include scenario analysis, multi-objective comparisons, and expression of uncertainty. Some cases may require combinations of these tasks.

##Objectives

Overall, this work aims to empower analysts and decision-makers with **easy approaches to clear ES visualizations and summaries**: effective solutions to synthesize and communicate spatial, multi-dimensional outputs of multiple runs for multiple ES models. The first objective of this work is to identify the challenges and the needs for an efficient communication of results. In a second phase, the aim is to suggest powerful and innovative solutions to address these points. That is, support the ES analysts and scientists by orienting them to (1) the range of display options available, and when they are suitable and (2) to the range of implementations of these display options to help ease the workflow of creating visualizations. It gathers an overview of existing display tools and builds upon these to improve natural capital visualizations 


## Outline 

This master thesis presents approaches to displaying natural capital information, highlighting diverse examples from the ES community, and providing new illustrations and tools based on  specific use cases in Kenya and Hawaii. Chapter 2 describes the adopted methodology, presents the context and use cases on which this work is embedded and detail the corresponding workflow. Chapter 3 provides the background knowledge on the basic principles of data visualization, and also briefly addresses the question of which tools to use. Chapter 4 gathers the existing knowledge on design strategies for displaying complex information, by summarizing an extended literature review that was conducted to explore the design strategies to displaying multi-dimensional, multi-objective, spatial and uncertain data. It suggests solutions for each identified display need, providing examples and tools. Table \ref{sec:table} summarizes the most common visualization needs and links them to suggested solutions. It is an informative and practical guidance proposing a toolbox and recommendations on best practices for ES analysts.
Then, to address some of the identified display needs for which no satisfying tool was found, an innovative display tool is conceived. It takes inspiration and builds upon existing tools and suggested solutions from chapter 4 to provide a tailored visualization interface suitable to the common issues identified. Its design and implementation is discussed in chapter 5, illustrated by a prototype developed for a specific use case. Finally, section 6 provides a summary of this work, along with a discussion about future steps.
