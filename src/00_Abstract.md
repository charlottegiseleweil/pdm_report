# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Natural capital assessments help decision-makers take nature into account by revealing specifically the benefits environmental assets provide and developing approaches to manage them sustainably. Visualization of the results is crucial to an effective communication and impact. However, no methodology exists to support analysts in synthetizing their results, and tools are scattered. This work aims to fill this gap. First, through a survey among the ES analysts community and an extended literature review in neighboring fields, is gathered the existing knowledge on design strategies to complex information display, tailored to the specificities of natural capital data, i.e multi-dimensionality, spatial, uncertainty, and multiple runs. Then, it scopes industry gaps by analyzing and prioritizing the needs, by surveying professionals. Based on these, a toolbox is developed to guide analysts in their task of communicating natural capital information. Aditionally, (a concept of) an innovative tool to do so is proposed. NatCapViz (or whatever name) allows visualization of tradeoffs between several ES objectives, comparison of scenarios and assessment of uncertainty with an interactive dashboard combining multiple linked views, in the form of a web application.

Natural capital assessments help decision-makers take the environmental assets into account by revealing specifically the benefits they provide, and developing approaches to manage them sustainably. An effective communication, including clear visualization of natural capital assessments results is crucial to influence decisions. However, no methodology exists to support analysts incrafting efficient visualizations, and tools are scattered. This work aims to fill this gap. 

First, it gathers the existing knowledge on design strategies to complex information display through a literature review and surveying professionals. Complex information refers here to the specificities of natural capital data, i.e spatial data, multi-dimensionality, accounting uncertainy and multiple runs. Secondly, it scopes the industry gaps by analyzing and prioritizing the visualization needs.

These lead to the development of a guidance, supporting analysts in their task of communicating natural capital information. Aditionally, an innovative tool to display natural capital results, combining knowledge from previous points in the form of a user-friendly ready-to-use (prototype of a) webapp is suggested.
