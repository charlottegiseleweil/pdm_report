# Conclusion

Working with Delite can be challenging. If used successfully, it can target heterogeneous parallel hardware architectures while providing productivity and performance.

In this report, we have presented the work we preformed to integrate a new loop fusion mechanism into Delite, as well as the benefits that this work provides on real world examples. We have also described tools that can be used to understand and debug staged programs. These tools can be used by DSL authors as well as Delite hackers to improve their programming experience.

Delite's barrier to entry remains quite high, and the need for better tooling is present. Better heuristics for applying optimizations could potentially bring performance improvements. The unique approach taken by Delite has already demonstrated its effectiveness, however, and we believe it has a bright future.
