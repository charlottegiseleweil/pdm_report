# Abstract

Generating efficient code from programs that heavily rely on high-level abstractions is difficult. Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are well-suited for this task because they have stronger semantics than general purpose languages. Delite provides an effective way of turning DSL programs into high-performance code. By using a simple core formalism, it can express a large variety of loop operations that capture precise program semantics. This simplified core reduces the complexity needed to express optimizing transformations. Delite's unique design can, however, be difficult to work with. In this work, we present how we integrated improved optimizations in Delite and demonstrate the benefits of those transformations. We also present a set of tools that simplify the engineering workflow for Delite programmers as well as users.
