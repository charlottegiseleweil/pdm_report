### generalities on assessing ES value, communicating ES results
The ecosystems that surround us are essential to our survival and well-being, and are the bedrock of a sustainable economy. Increasingly, we can map the most important forests, coastal habitats and other ecosystems and show how they support us. This is crucial in order to prioritize the use of resources and sustainably manage our natural world. 


###Applications : uncertainty analysis, scenario assessment, spatial optimization ...

###	Natural capital assessments
The benefits nature provides to people and the economy are ...Natural capital assessments aims to provide informations on the matter, and estimate quantitavely the value of these. 

Because degradation or loss of ecosystem benefits would incur costs, for example for water treatment, erosion control, infrastructure maintenance and disaster relief; it would undermine security, prosperity and economic development. Therefore, a thorough understanding of ecosystem assest is crucial. Natural capital assessments locates the sources of ecosystem services, provides indications for sustainable management, identifies and prioritizes conservation activies, helps build understanding of synergies and trade-offs between the needs and impacts of different projects or sectors, supports policy design, contributes to climate resilience and adaptation planning. Strong of this understanding, enlightened decisions can be taken to secure these assets for economic and social development [@Myanmar16].

### Communicating natural capital results

### Importance of viz

It is easier for the brain to comprehend an image versus words or numbers (A special report on managing information. Cukier, 2010),

TODO (TO REPHRASE THIS IS COPY/PASTE)
Thoroughly explored, (Cleveland, 1994; Ware, 2000; Spence, 2001; Few, 2004, Tufte; 2006; Strange, 2007 and more), the topic of visualization is key in research presentation and communication because it allows to synthesize into effective graphics large amounts of data (C. Ware Information Visualization: Perception for Design, 2000 todo). Visualization serves two major purposes, data analysis (Rebolj and Sturm, 1999, Jeong et al., 2006, Kollat and Reed, 2007, Wagener and Kollat, 2007 and Xu et al., 2010) and data presentation. The latter is the focus of this work, assuming that the analysis is completed.

It has been shown that combining optimization with visualization promotes design innovations and empowers decision makers with a better understanding of systems behaviors ([@Kollat_Video], [@Reed04], [@Fleming05], [@Winer02] and many more)

##The Natural Capital Project
The Natural Capital Project aims develop practical tools and approaches to account for nature’s contributions to society, so that leaders worldwide can take into account the value of ecosystem services, to make smarter decisions for a more sustainable future. Founded in 199??, the Natural Capital Project gathers NGOs and academia, namely the World Wild Fund (WWF), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), University of Minnessota and Stanford University. 
A very common question the Natural Capital Project tries to answer is: Where should activitiesor changes be made on a landscape to best meet different objectives related to ecosystemservices? For example – where should upstream investments in sediment-retention interventionsbe placed to best improve water quality? If there are multiple interventions possible, are theretrade-offs between improving water quality and water flows? Are there trade-offs withagricultural productivity? NatCap is in the process of transitioning from so called “index-based”approaches for optimization (as exemplified in its RIOS tool), to approaches that are based onactually running ecosystem service models and assessing the difference each intervention causesat each place on the landscape (“marginal value” approaches). At the same time, we are workingto more directly consider tradeoffs between agricultural outcomes (like improved yields) withwater-related outcomes. Both of these enhancements require solving a number of analytic anddata problems as well as testing the value and adequacy of alternate approaches. Some ofthese are “algorithmic” problems about how often and in what way models need to be run to doreliable optimization, and some are data problems about ways to find simple relationships thatcan allow for better integration across different models involved in an optimization.

###The Upper Tana Nairobi Water Fund*Improving Water for Millions in Kenya*The Tana River supplies 95 percent of the water for Nairobi’s 4 million residents, and for another 5 million people living in the watershed. It also feeds one of the country’s most important agricultural areas and provides half of the country’s hydropower output. With Nairobi contributing 60 percent of the country’s GDP, the Tana River truly fuels Kenya’s economic growth.Since the 1970s, forests on steep hillsides and areas of wetlands have been converted to agriculture, removing natural areas for storing runoff water and soil from the land. Now, as rain falls over farms, soils are washed down into the river, which reduces the productivity of farmland and sends sediment into the rivers. This increased sedimentation can choke water treatment and distribution facilities causing complete service disruptions for days or weeks at a time. Today, 60 percent of Nairobi’s residents do not have access to a reliable water supply.This growing challenge requires something innovative to protect the Tana River, increase downstream water quality and quantity and provide positive benefits for tens of thousands of farmers in the watershed. Enter the Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund. Water funds are founded on the principle that it is cheaper to prevent water problems at the source than it is to address them further downstream. Public and private donors and major water consumers downstream contribute to the Fund to support upstream water and soil conservation measures, resulting in improved water quality and supply.The Nairobi Water Fund builds on the Conservancy’s experience addressing similar issues in Latin America, where more than 30 water funds are either underway or in development. This fund is now the first of its kind in Africa, and will serve as a model as leaders across the continent look for innovative ways to solve ever-increasing water challenges.• Training for 15,000 farmers• Establishing the business case a $10 million USD investment in water fund-ledconservation interventions is likely to return $21.5 million USD in economic benefitsover a 30-year timeframe.• Our current partners and investors are: Nairobi City Water & Sewerage Company, KenyaElectricity Generating Company (KenGen), Pentair Inc, Coca Cola, East Africa Breweries Ltd, International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), The Government of Kenya, Water Resources Management Authority (WRMA), Tana & Athi Rivers
