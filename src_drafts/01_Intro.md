#Introduction##Motivation : generalities on assessing ES value, communicating ES results
Applications : uncertainty analysis, scenario assessment, spatial optimization ...

It has been shown that combining optimization with visualization promotes design innovations and empowers decision makers with a better understanding of systems behaviors ([@Kollat_Video], [@Reed04], [@Fleming05], [@Winer02] and many more)

##Background, context : on natural capital and ES assessmt

##The Natural Capital Project (e.g Tana River)

##Scoping of this project (project definition...)

##Objectives
How to synthesize and communicate spatial/multi-dimensional outputs of multiple runs for multiple ES models ?

Easy approaches to clear ES viz and summaries,
