1. **Kappa index of agreement** (KIA or Cohen's Kappa) is a statistic measuring concordance between categorical items. This technique has proven efficient for cell-by-cell comparisons of spatial data [@Manson2005], as long as patterns and locations of changes are not involved [@Kuhnert2005]. Some variants have been developped to adress the quantity and the location fit (points 2 and 3 below) as well ([@Hagen2003] and [@Pontius2000] ) It is more robust than a percent agreement because it takes into account the agreement occuring by chance. ![equation](http://bit.ly/2ghTOSb) with ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=p_%7B0%7D&bc=White&fc=Black&im=png&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0) being the proportion of units agreeing, and ![equation](http://bit.ly/2fCZWD4) the proportion of units expected to agree by chance (i.e the hypothetical probability of chance agreement). Complete agreeement results in ![equation](http://bit.ly/2f4enE1) = 1 [@Cohen1960]. 
1. The **quantity fit** informs on the number of cells that changed from one category to another, offering an overall comparison on the quantity of each category: [todo @ Pontius2002 cf Kuhnert2005]

where LATEXa_{ki} is the number of cells assigned to category i, in map k. (k LATEXappartient 1,2), N the total number of cells in map and C means all categories.
