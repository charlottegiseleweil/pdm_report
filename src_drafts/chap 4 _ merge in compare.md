TO GO IN COMPARE


###Compare many maps 
#### ES model outputs (continuous)
In the past for PPFs using raster data, I have converted cells to points in ArcGIS and attached service values at each point to the attribute table. With fine scale rasters of spatially continuous service value, it is usually only necessary to extract a sample of these points into a data. This data is then imported into R for visualization and further processing.


I have traditionally handled visualizing uncertainty via tabular representations, as spatial representations can often be difficult to digest.
