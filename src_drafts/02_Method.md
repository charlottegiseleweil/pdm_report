#Methodology ##Approaching the problem 

##Identifying display needs
Typical cases, 
surveying and interviewing (Hydrologist, economists etc)at the Natural cpital project
##Build the display toolbox structure : user-friendly, useful

##Prioritize the needs##Developp tools for most needed displays, implementation methodology
### Hawaii case
#### Defining the needs
In terms of static visualizations. The main goal of the paper  is to look at the impact of restoration (land cover scenarios) on the ES objectives (water, flammability) both independently and then simultaneously with climate scenarios going on in the background.
