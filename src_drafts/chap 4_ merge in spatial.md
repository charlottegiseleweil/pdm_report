TO GO IN SPATIAL

##Scale
###Consistency of spatial pattern in pixel data (at coarser resolution)###Display fine-scale data aggregated by polygons


##Spatial data: portfolios and ES model outputs
Suggested tool: QGIS (or ArcGIS, with requires a license) (CV / HRA Dashboards)
*Possible tools : ArcGIS, QGIS, PyGeoprocessing, Python, matplotlib, R, CV / HRA Dashboards*

>>in chloropleth:
 a portfolio *//repeats 3.2.2 ?*
Static maps are relevant for this simple case. Careful care must be given to symbology, see recommendations in section \ref{sec:colors}.

### Specific portfolios displays


### Specific spatial ES model outputs displays
(continuous data, at pixel or polygon level. e.g objective scores)"

#### Spatial prioritization of intervention(s)
maps of activity locations with different colors for each activity, using pixel- or polygon- data outputs from RIOS or ROOT. And/or a table summarizing ha in each intervention by administrative area or sub-watershed. (Example? Adrian)
#### Impact of intervention on a specific ES metric
Where in space does a given intervention or scenario improve or worsen a specific ES metric? e.g Where does an activity contribute to objectives ?

1. We've usually just looked at overall change in ES between baseline and scenario, after implementing the intervention, either as a single value over an area of interest, or as a change map side by side with the intervention map
2. difference map based on InVEST output from baseline and intervention scenarios.

#### Location of synergies/tradeoffs of intervention/scenario on multiple ES metrics
 Where does an intervention move multiple ES metrics (aka objectives) in the same direction ? Where are the "win-wins"? Where in space is a given intervention or scenario contribute to some metrics at the expense of others?

1. We've either shown change maps for each ES alongside each other, or " (Example? Stacie)
2. side by side
3. easy, quantitative comparison of scenarios is more cumbersome 

##### Subquestion : Intensity of tradeoffs and synergies in space
Where are tradeoffs more or less stark?

###Relationship/agreement between two variables

>> =Spatial correlation
A very cool way of displaying spatial correlation between an ES and something (here LER) [@jgong]

###Displaying the beneficiaries
Growing interest in this topic (from survey). Very context specific.
Good example to cite : myanmar people (display-examples/people_depend)
###Show/quantify beneficiaries impact (by subgroups)###Location of beneficiaries in space 
Iwe only represent this by generalized population groups, could get better at disaggregating?###Contrast beneficiary distribution in space with service distribution in space
