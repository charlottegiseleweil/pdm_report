# Conclusion & Next Steps

##(There will be something here)
As the community is longing for a standardized method to quantify and map ES (@Englund, @Crossman, @Maria) (in terms of scale, types of ES...), number of strategies are being developed on the visualization front. Interactive tools are being more and more used, as tools to develop them are becoming more and more accessible


Similarly to @Englund, it is found to be difficult to generalize one best method. Rather, best practices were suggested. Approaches are very context dependent. According to the aim, intended audience, analyst competence, data availabiloty, time frame ...


##Open questions: Areas of improvement

####Scale 
####Beneficiaries

#### Impact of intervention on a specific ES metric
Where in space does a given intervention or scenario improve or worsen a specific ES metric? e.g Where does an activity contribute to objectives ?
1. We've usually just looked at overall change in ES between baseline and scenario, after implementing the intervention, either as a single value over an area of interest, or as a change map side by side with the intervention map
