# Conclusion 

## On standardizing approaches to communicate natural capital results 

As many in the ES community are calling for a standardized method to quantify and map ES (@Englund, @Crossman, @Maria), a number of strategies are being developed on the visualization front. Interactive tools are becoming increasingly common, as platforms to develop them are becoming more and more accessible.

Similarly to @Englund, this study finds it difficult to point one best method generically adequate to all cases. Rather, best practices were suggested in a display "toolbox" (chapters \ref{sec:elements} and \ref{sec:UserGuide}). Approaches are very context dependent. The tools and types of display must be chosen according to the aim, intended audience, analyst skills, data availability, time frame and other factors.

Remain some open questions and areas of improvements were identified. The question of the scale, **the effect of the resolution** chosen on the results can be further explored. Additionally, the survey noted growing interest in the topic of **beneficiaries**. Not only quantifying the people benefiting from an intervention, but more precisely adding nuance in demographics or social metrics to the analysis, classify by subgroups (e.g. which fraction of service benefits accrue to vulnerable populations?) and/or contrast beneficiary distribution in space with service distribution in space.

The engaging aspect rising from dynamic features and the **interactivity** was expressed, as shown by the enthusiasm suscited by the interactive dashboard prototype developed alongside this toolbox [@Weil]. This observation calls for development of more modern engaging tools, leveraging the abilities offered by the tools ad develoment environments becoming more and more common an accessible.

## Engaging a broader audience into major decisions on natural capital sustainable management

There is an enormous potential for environmental impact and climate change mitigation through an informed management of natural capital. So called conservation finance (i.e. a financial investment that aims to conserve the values of the ecosystem for the long term, as defined by @McKinsey) has a large unrealized potential, there is a significant unmet demand for investment[^9222back], and aligned intentions to promote natural capital sustainable management both from the political world - as illustrated by the Paris agreement and the 17 UN sustainable development goals among others (@Cop21, @Guardian) - and also emerging in the finance world (see [the Conservation Finance Network](http://www.conservationfinancenetwork.org/) for example). 
However, one main obstacle for investors, in the hardly measurable aspect of return on investment and conservation benefits. But natural capital assessments tackles this exact question. 

Building on this observation, the hypothesis can be formulated that linking the right expertise would allow to bridge the gaps and open the doors to many desired investments and high impact projects: partnering investors looking for long term reliable and meaningful project with cutting-edge scientists modeling the behavior of ecosystems to quantify the costs and benefits from natural capital and its sustainable management. Several initiatives are going in this direction, Credit Suisse for example, expressed their long-term intent of creating a conservation finance asset class [@CS]. It has been proven to be possible to deliver great conservation impacts while generating returns for investors [@McKinsey]. 

However, their success seems contingent upon the ability of several fields to work together; linking different expertise seem indeed required bridge the gaps (for example through partnering investors looking for long term reliable and meaningful project with cutting-edge scientists modeling the behavior of ecosystems to quantify the costs and benefits from natural capital and its sustainable management). Multi-disciplinary communication therefore appears as a crucial aspect. In this context, data visualization tools play a key role to connect the complex scientific results to the real world.

Effective visualizations of natural capital assessment results must simplify their complexity to be understandable, while staying rigorous. Plus they communicate key points in an engaging way, allowing more actors to get involved in natural capital sustainable management. By involving a broader audience into major decisions, they support a participative and democratic approach to solving problems impacting large communities.

Advances in the topic of communication of natural capital assessments would arguably facilitate engagement of a broader audience and help natural capital conservation projects  achieve their tremendous potential to impact, at large scale. 

[^9222back]: @McKinsey calculates that, to meet the global need for conservation funding, investable cash flows from conservation projects need to be at least 20-30 times greater than they are today, reaching USD 200-300 billion per year.
